# PillReminder
This project tries to solve a problem that people who are clueless have when taking medication. In my case, I have hypothyroidism and I have to take my medication every day, but many times I forget it. Or maybe don't remember if I have taken it or not

To achieve this, the following hardware is used:
- Arduino nano
- LDR resistance
- 5v LED
- Dupont cables
- 3D Printer to make the base 

The functionality is quite simple; the pill blister covers the LDR resistance and that sensor gets a low value because it's covered. Until the blister is not lifted, the red light is ON. When is lifted, the red light turns off and waits the time needed to the next dose and turn on again the red light.

*This project is actually under development, but it has a working version for detect possible bugs. That idea occurred to me last night and I started from 0, so it can still be improved a lot and add functionalities!*
